# blending 

This project is just to illustrate an issue with color transparency and blending in the clojurescript version of quil.

## Usage

Run `lein compile` command and open `index.html` in your browser.

For interactive development run `lein cljsbuild auto` command. This command will be recompiling cljs to js each time you modify `core.cljs` and you can see result immediately by refreshing page.
